# Password Generator Starter Code
 
## Description
This project is for generating password with specific character criteria. The HTML and CSS was provided by the Rice Bootcamp. From there a Javascript file was created. The first thing that I created was the variables using "var." Each variable broke down the possible characters that could be used in the random password. The last two variables created are to create a more overarching "characterchoices" variable where the criteria can fall into when created via concatenation to connect strings. "endingPassword" was also created with a concatenation using strings. Next functions were created with those variables to execute various different activities on the page. generatePassword function was created to give the user the ability to choose which criteria they would like to use in their password once generated. If statements were used to include or exclude the criteria. Follow the comments to for further detail! 

## Contributions
The bootcamp classes acted as contributions to this project. Without the courses I would have been completely lost. Rene Trevino, our class assistant and tutor helped immensly in the understanding of this assignment.
